## Quick Guide

### Prerequisites

```shell
node: "^>=22.12.0"
pnpm: "^11.5.2"
# otherwise, your build will fail
```

We recommend using Corepack, [read PNPM docs](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-corepack).

### Setting up your local repo

Vite DEploy uses pnpm workspaces, so you should **always run `pnpm install` from the top-level project directory**. Running `pnpm install` in the top-level project root will install dependencies for every package in the repo.

```shell
git clone && cd ...
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

### Development

```shell
# starts a file-watching, live-reloading dev script for active development
pnpm packages dev
# build the entire project, one time.
pnpm build
```

**How can I test my changes while contributing to the repository?**

During the development process, you may want to test your changes to ensure they are working as expected. Here are a few ways to do it:

1. Run any of the examples in the `/examples` folder. They are linked to use the local packages, so you can see the effects of your changes.

   ```shell
    pnpm --filter @example/cloudflare-static run dev
   ```

2. Write a test and run it. This is useful if you're making a specific fix and want to see if your changes are working as expected.

3. Create a separate project and use your local package through [`pnpm link`](https://pnpm.io/cli/link). This is helpful if you're making bigger changes and want to test them in a separate project.

Overall, it's up to personal preference which method to use. For smaller changes, using the examples folder may be sufficient. For larger changes, using a separate project may be more appropriate.

### Other useful commands

```shell
# auto-format the entire project
# (optional - a GitHub Action formats every commit after a PR is merged)
pnpm run format
```

```shell
# lint the project
# (optional - our linter creates helpful warnings, but not errors.)
pnpm run lint
```

### Making a Pull Request

When making a pull request, be sure to add a changeset when something has changed with Vite Deploy. Non-packages (`examples/*`) do not need changesets.

```shell
pnpm exec changeset
```
